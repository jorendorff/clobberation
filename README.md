# Clobberation: Edit text with a friend and destroy their work

*(stab 1)*

The code here is meant as a motivating example for
[a talk on CRDTs](https://github.com/jorendorff/talks/blob/master/textarea-distributed/textarea-distributed.md).

The hope is that the fact that we're continually destroying work
will be self-evidently horrible enough
that CRDTs will seem amazing by comparison.

There are other approaches, but they all have problems.
