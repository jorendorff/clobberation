# Clobberation: How not to implement collaborative editing

*(stab 1)*

The code here is meant as a motivating example
for a talk on [CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type).

The hope is that the fact that we're continually destroying work
will be self-evidently horrible enough
that CRDTs will seem amazing by comparison.

There are other approaches, but they all have problems.
